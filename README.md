# FLORA — E-Commerce Website 🌿


## 📋 Project Notes

Welcome to the Flora project! This is a simplified e-commerce website designed with a user-friendly experience in mind. 
The project is built around "Flora," a fictional brand created to provide context, purpose, and personality to the design.

The project includes a minimalistic brand identity, featuring custom typography, colors, and graphic elements. The design was first prototyped in Figma and later implemented using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
